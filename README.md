# ECLibrary

Type here your framework's description

## Getting Started

To start building the framework, you must install the required dependencies, xctool and cmake. We recommend using Homebrew to install these two tools.
Once you have the dependencies you should clone this repository and then run script/bootstrap. This will automatically pull down and install any other dependencies.
Note that the bootstrap script automatically installs some libraries that ECLibrary relies upon, using Homebrew. If you want this behavior, please make sure you have Homebrew installed.
To develop ECLibrary on its own, open the ECLibrary.xcworkspace file.
